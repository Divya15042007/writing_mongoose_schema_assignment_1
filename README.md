# **How to Fork and Set Up Your Repository**

---

## **1. Fork the Repository on StackBlitz**
- You will be provided with a **StackBlitz** link for the assignment.
- Open the link in your browser and click on the **Fork** button in StackBlitz.  
  This will create a copy of the repository in your StackBlitz account.

---

## **2. Clone the Repository to Your Personal GitHub**
- After forking, you can download the project or push it directly to your personal GitHub repository:
  - **Option 1: Download and Push**
    1. Download the repository files from StackBlitz.
    2. Open your terminal/command prompt, navigate to the project folder, and run:
       ```bash
       git init
       git remote add origin <your_github_repo_url>
       ```
       Replace `<your_github_repo_url>` with your personal GitHub repository URL.
    3. Commit and push the files to your GitHub repository:
       ```bash
       git add .
       git commit -m "Completed the assignment"
       git push -u origin main
       ```
  - **Option 2: Push Directly**
    1. Use the **Push to GitHub** option in StackBlitz to directly connect and push the repository to your GitHub account.

---

## **3. Submission Instructions**
- Once your code is successfully pushed to GitHub:
  1. Copy the link to your GitHub repository.
  2. Submit the link on the assignment submission portal.  
     The link should follow this format:  
     **`https://github.com/<your_username>/<repository_name>`**

---

### **Example Submission**
If your GitHub username is `johnDoe` and the repository name is `assignment-repo`, the submission link would look like this:  
**`https://github.com/johnDoe/assignment-repo`**
